If you want, I can also **make a 1-page “exam-ready step list with commands and screenshots”** you can **write directly in your practical exam**.

Do you want me to do that?









Program 5: Demonstrate continuous integration and development using Jenkins.

Aim: CI/CD pipeline with a GitHub repository:

•	Login to the GitHub account.
•	Next, navigate to the repository url, suppose MyShuttle2. Once you are on the repo page, click the Fork button
•	Add a new file to the repository named Jenkinsfile. A Jenkinsfile is a text file that contains the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline. This file should be inside the source code repository.
•	Type the pipeline script in Jenkinsfile as the name of the new file.
Press commit new file, at the bottom of the page.
•	This will show the jenkinsfile in your repository.
•	As you will need the resulting URL during the Jenkins CI CD pipeline creation, copy the repository URL.

Creating Jenkins CI CD Pipeline:

Step 1: Login into your Jenkins account as shown below.

Step 2. To create a new project select the option available in the Dashboard which is “New Item” Refer to the image provided below:

Step 3. Now a list of options will be visible on the screen, along with a field to name the pipeline. Add a suitable name and select the “Pipeline” option to proceed.
 
Step 4. Now comes the second section, i.e. “General”. Here, we need to specify the branch and repository and give the credentials too. And add additional behaviors if required so far.

Step 5. This is the last section i.e. “Pipeline”. Here the user specifies from where the scripts will be imported including the path to the file, repository, credentials, etc.
•	Confirm that the Script Path value is Jenkinsfile. This value refers the Jenkinsfile you created earlier, click Save.
 
Step 6. After writing the pipeline is done click on save it will be directly redirected to the Dashboard of the project there we can use, the “Build Now” option to run the pipeline and check if it is successful or not, by using stage view or console output.
we can see the outcome of the pipeline in the stage view where as shown in the image below.
And we can also see the console output where we can see logs of each and every step which is performed.

Click on the console output to see the logs of each and every stage that is performed by using the pipeline.
Scroll down to the end of the console output there we can see the status of the pipeline if it is “Finished: success” . The pipeline which we have written was a success.
