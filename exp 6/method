Program 6: Docker

Sure! Let’s go one by one, and I’ll explain each Docker command in very simple language with examples so it’s easy to understand.
________________________________________
1. docker --version
•	Purpose: Checks which version of Docker is installed on your system.
•	Example:
docker --version
•	Output example: Docker version 24.0.5, build abc123
•	Explanation: This tells you Docker is installed and which version it is. Useful before running other commands to ensure your Docker is up-to-date.
________________________________________
2. docker pull <image-name>
•	Purpose: Downloads a Docker image from Docker Hub to your local machine.
•	Example:
docker pull nginx
•	Explanation:
o	Here, nginx is the name of the image.
o	After running this, the image is available locally, so you can run containers from it.
•	Tip: If you don’t pull an image, Docker automatically downloads it when you run a container.
________________________________________
3. docker ps
•	Purpose: Lists all currently running containers.
•	Example:
docker ps
•	Output columns:
o	CONTAINER ID → unique ID of the container
o	IMAGE → image used to create the container
o	STATUS → whether the container is running
•	Explanation: Lets you see which containers are actively running.
________________________________________
4. docker ps -a
•	Purpose: Lists all containers, including running and stopped/exited.
•	Example:
docker ps -a
•	Explanation: This helps you find containers that ran previously but are now stopped. You might want to restart or remove them later.
________________________________________
5. docker exec -it <container-id> bash
•	Purpose: Access a running container’s terminal.
•	Example:
docker exec -it 123abc bash
•	Explanation:
o	123abc → container ID.
o	bash → opens a Linux shell inside the container.
•	Use case: Useful for debugging or running commands inside a container.
________________________________________
6. docker stop <container-id>
•	Purpose: Stops a running container gracefully.
•	Example:
docker stop 123abc
•	Explanation:
o	Docker tells the container to stop its processes cleanly.
o	Recommended way to stop containers to avoid data loss.
________________________________________
7. docker kill <container-id>
•	Purpose: Stops a container immediately, without waiting.
•	Example:
docker kill 123abc
•	Difference from docker stop:
o	stop → waits for container to shut down gracefully.
o	kill → stops it instantly (like an emergency stop).
________________________________________
8. docker images
•	Purpose: Lists all Docker images downloaded locally.
•	Example:
docker images
•	Output columns:
o	REPOSITORY → image name
o	TAG → version of image (like latest)
o	IMAGE ID → unique ID of image
o	SIZE → size of image
•	Explanation: Helps you see which images are available to run containers or remove if not needed.
________________________________________
9. docker rm <container-id>
•	Purpose: Deletes a stopped container.
•	Example:
docker rm 123abc
•	Explanation:
o	Containers take up disk space.
o	You cannot remove a running container with this command; it must be stopped first.
•	Tip: Remove multiple containers at once:
docker rm 123abc 456def
________________________________________
10. docker rmi <image-id>
•	Purpose: Deletes a Docker image from local storage.
•	Example:
docker rmi nginx
•	Explanation:
o	Frees up space if you no longer need the image.
o	You cannot delete an image if containers are still using it.

✅ Summary in Simple Words:
•	docker --version → check Docker version
•	docker pull → download image
•	docker ps → running containers
•	docker ps -a → all containers (running + stopped)
•	docker exec -it → enter a container
•	docker stop → stop container safely
•	docker kill → stop container immediately
•	docker images → list downloaded images
•	docker rm → delete stopped container
•	docker rmi → delete image
